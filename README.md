# Armbian

View Chinese description | [查看中文说明](README.cn.md)

Armbian is a lightweight Linux system specially built for ARM chips based on Debian/Ubuntu. The Armbian system is lean, clean, and 100% compatible with and inherits the features and rich software ecosystem of the Debian/Ubuntu system. It can run securely and stably in TF/SD/USB and the device's eMMC. This project preserves the integrity of the official Armbian system and further expands its usage on devices such as TV boxes that are not officially supported. It adds some convenient operation commands. Now, you can replace the Android TV system on your TV box with the Armbian system, turning it into a powerful server.

This project relies on many [contributors](CONTRIBUTORS.md) to build the Armbian system for `Amlogic`, `Rockchip`, and `Allwinner` boxes, supports writing to eMMC for use, supports updating the kernel and other features. Detailed usage can be found in the [Armbian User Documentation](./documents). The latest Armbian system can be downloaded from [Releases](https://github.com/ophub/amlogic-s9xxx-armbian/releases). Welcome to `Fork` and personalize. If it's useful to you, you can click `Star` in the upper right corner of the repository to show support.

## Installation and Upgrade Instructions for Armbian

Choose the Armbian system that corresponds to your box model, and refer to the corresponding instructions for different devices.

- ### Install Armbian to EMMC

1. For `Rockchip` platform, please refer to the [Chapter 8](documents#8-installing-armbian-to-emmc) in the instruction document.

2. For `Amlogic` and `Allwinner` platforms, use tools such as [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/) or [balenaEtcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) to write the system to a USB stick, then insert the USB stick with the written system into the box. Log in to the Armbian system (default user: root, default password: 1234) → Enter the command:

```shell
armbian-install
```

| Optional | Default | Options | Description       |
| -------- | ------- | ------- | ----------------- |
| -m       | no      | yes/no  | Use mainline u-boot |
| -a       | yes     | yes/no  | Use [ampart](https://github.com/7Ji/ampart) partition adjustment tool |
| -l       | no      | yes/no  | Show a list of all devices |

Example: `armbian-install -m yes -a no`

- ### Update Armbian Kernel

Log in to the Armbian system → Enter the command:

```shell
# Run as root user (sudo -i)
# If no parameter is specified, it will be updated to the latest version.
armbian-update
```

| Optional | Default      | Options       | Description                      |
| -------- | ------------ | ------------- | -------------------------------- |
| -r       | ophub/kernel | `<owner>/<repo>` | Set the repository to download the kernel from github.com |
| -u       | Automation   | stable/flippy/dev/beta/rk3588/rk35xx/h6 | Set the [tags suffix](https://github.com/ophub/kernel/releases) of the kernel in use |
| -k       | Latest version | Kernel version | Set the [kernel version](https://github.com/ophub/kernel/releases/tag/kernel_stable) |
| -b       | yes          | yes/no        | Automatically back up the current system's kernel when updating the kernel |
| -m       | no           | yes/no        | Use mainline u-boot |
| -s       | None         | None/DiskName | [SOS] Restore the system kernel in eMMC/NVMe/sdX and other disks |
| -h       | None         | None          | View help |

Example: `armbian-update -k 5.15.50 -u dev`

When specifying the kernel version number through the `-k` parameter, you can accurately specify a specific version number, for example: `armbian-update -k 5.15.50`, or you can specify the kernel series vaguely, for example: `armbian-update -k 5.15`. When vaguely specified, the latest version of the specified series will be automatically used.

When updating the kernel, the currently used kernel will be automatically backed up and stored in the `/ddbr/backup` directory. The backup keeps the three most recent versions of the kernel. If the newly installed kernel is unstable, you can easily restore the backup kernel at any time. If the kernel update fails and the system cannot boot, you can restore the system kernel using `armbian-update -s`. For more details, see the [Help Document](documents#10-updating-armbian-kernel).

- ### Replace Armbian sources

Log in to the Armbian system → Enter the command:

```shell
armbian-apt
```

Choosing the appropriate software source for your country or region can improve software download speeds. For more details, see the [Help Document](documents#11-installing-common-software).

- ### Install Common Software

Log in to the Armbian system → Enter the command:

```shell
armbian-software
```

The command `armbian-software -u` can update the local software center list. Based on the demand feedback from users in [Issue](https://github.com/ophub/amlogic-s9xxx-armbian/issues), we gradually integrate commonly used [software](build-armbian/armbian-files/common-files/usr/share/ophub/armbian-software/software-list.conf) to achieve one-click installation/update/uninstallation and other shortcut operations. This includes `docker images`, `desktop software`, `application services`, etc. For more details, see the [instructions](documents/armbian_software.md).

- ### Modify Armbian Configuration

Log in to the Armbian system → Enter the command:

```shell
armbian-config
```

- ### Create swap for Armbian

If you feel that the current box's memory is insufficient when using applications that consume a lot of memory, such as `docker`, you can create a `swap` virtual memory partition, virtually using a certain capacity of disk space as memory. The unit of the input parameter of the following command is `GB`, the default is `1`.

Log in to the Armbian system → Enter the command:

```shell
armbian-swap 1
```

- ### Control LED Display

Log in to the Armbian system → Enter the command:

```shell
armbian-openvfd
```

Debug according to the [LED Screen Display Control Instructions](documents/led_screen_display_control.md).

- ### Backup/Restore EMMC Original System

Supports backing up/restoring the `EMMC` partition of the box in `TF/SD/USB`. Before installing the Armbian system in a brand new box, it is recommended that you back up the Android TV system that comes with the current box so that it can be used in the future to restore the TV system and other situations.

Please boot the Armbian system from `TF/SD/USB` → Enter the command:

```shell
armbian-ddbr
```

Enter `b` according to the prompt to back up the system, and enter `r` to restore the system.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In addition, the Android system can also be flashed into eMMC using the method of flashing via a cable. The download image of the Android system can be found in [Tools](https://github.com/ophub/kernel/releases/tag/tools).

- ### Compile the Kernel in Armbian

For the usage of compiling the kernel in Armbian, please refer to the [Compile Kernel](compile-kernel) instruction document. Log in to the Armbian system → Enter the command:

```shell
armbian-kernel -u
armbian-kernel -k 6.6.12
```

- ### More Usage Instructions

To update all service scripts in the local system to the latest version, you can log in to the Armbian system → Enter the command:

```shell
armbian-sync
```

In the use of Armbian, some common problems that may be encountered can be found in [documents](documents)

## Local Packaging

1. Clone the repository to local `git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/ophub/amlogic-s9xxx-armbian.git`

2. Install the necessary software packages (scripts have only been tested under x86_64 Ubuntu-20.04/22.04)

```shell
sudo apt-get update -y
sudo apt-get full-upgrade -y
# For Ubuntu-22.04
sudo apt-get install -y $(cat compile-kernel/tools/script/ubuntu2204-build-armbian-depends)
```

3. Enter the `~/amlogic-s9xxx-armbian` root directory, create a `build/output/images` folder in the root directory, and upload the Armbian image file (such as `Armbian_21.11.0-trunk_Odroidn2_current_5.15.50.img`) to `~/amlogic-s9xxx-armbian/build/output/images` directory. Please keep the release version number (such as `21.11.0`) and the kernel version number (such as `5.15.50`) in the original Armbian image file name. It will be used as the name of the Armbian system after restructuring.

4. Enter the `~/amlogic-s9xxx-armbian` root directory, and then run the `sudo ./rebuild -b s905x3 -k 6.6.12` command to generate the Armbian image file for the specified board. The generated file is saved in the `build/output/images` directory.

## Armbian Contributors

First of all, thanks to [150balbes](https://github.com/150balbes) for the outstanding contributions and the solid foundation laid for using Armbian in Amlogic TV boxes. The [Armbian](https://github.com/armbian/build) system compiled here directly uses the latest source code from the official in real-time. The development ideas of the program come from tutorials from authors such as [ebkso](https://www.kflyo.com/howto-compile-armbian-for-n1-box). Thank you all for your dedication and sharing, allowing us to use the Armbian system in more boxes.

The [u-boot](https://github.com/ophub/u-boot), [kernel](https://github.com/ophub/kernel) and other resources used in this system are mainly copied from the [unifreq/openwrt_packit](https://github.com/unifreq/openwrt_packit) project, and some files are provided by users in [Pull](https://github.com/ophub/amlogic-s9xxx-armbian/pulls) and [Issues](https://github.com/ophub/amlogic-s9xxx-armbian/issues) of projects such as [amlogic-s9xxx-openwrt](https://github.com/ophub/amlogic-s9xxx-openwrt), [amlogic-s9xxx-armbian](https://github.com/ophub/amlogic-s9xxx-armbian), [luci-app-amlogic](https://github.com/ophub/luci-app-amlogic), [u-boot](https://github.com/ophub/u-boot) and [kernel](https://github.com/ophub/kernel).
